project: FontTwo

description: 'FontTwo is a type family with four very diverse members. They are designed to work together in digital environments. The text styles reveal their character in reading sizes and continuous lines, while the display styles reveal the ability to change appearance. ¶ FontTwo Serif has a regular, low contrast and slightly squarish counters which create a consistent colour in running text. The general squarish appearance is emphasized through a generous x-height and short ascenders and descenders. While keeping the same horizontal proportions, FontTwo Italic is visibly narrower and introduces more contrast to the shapes. ¶ FontTwo Display is an eccentric variable font, containing two stylistically different extremes and playing with the idea of contradiction. It can switch from a blocky and static appearance.'
